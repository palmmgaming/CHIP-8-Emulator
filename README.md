# Introduction
 My name is Phuriphan Prathipasen - Computer Engineering Student at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat University (2nd year)
 
 I am interested in low-level programming and want to applied the computer architecture knowledges that I have learned in the university. That is the reason I chose to make CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter.
 
 # Objective
 - To enhance my own skills in computer related field.
 - To understand how emulator/interpreter works.
 - To applied the knowledges that I've learned in the university.

# CHIP8 Emulator
 CHIP-8 was created by RCA engineer Joe Weisbecker in 1977 for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer. It was intended as a simpler way to make small programs and games for the computer.
 CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
